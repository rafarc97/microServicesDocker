VALIDATION ASSESMENT

As a insurance company we've been asked to develop an application that
manage some information about our insurance policies and company clients.
To do that, we have two services that provide us with all the data needed:

* The list of company clients can be found at:
http://www.mocky.io/v2/5808862710000087232b75ac

* The list of company policies can be found at:
http://www.mocky.io/v2/580891a4100000e8242b75c5

With that information, we need to create a Web API that exposes services
with some constraints:

* Get user data filtered by user id 
* Get user data filterd by user name 
* Get the list of policies linked to a user name 
* Get the user linked to a policy 

We have the following constraints:

* To use Postman to check queries	
* Usage of last technologies (mandatory Node.js)
* Solution properly structured and documented

As our stakeholders are very fussy, here you have some tips:

* Add everything you thing it's needed to ensure product's quality.
* Research about the best npm (e.g Axios)
* Try to “dockerize” some code.
